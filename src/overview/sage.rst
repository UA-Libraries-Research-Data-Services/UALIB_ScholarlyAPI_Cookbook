Brief Overview
****************

Sage Journals [#sage1]_ allow downloading of articles for which you have legitimate access (e.g. open access articles and those included in your institution's subscription) for non-commercial text and data mining (see restrictions in terms [#sage2]_ ). Access to text and data mining with Sage resources requires prior approval. Contact UA Libraries or your institution to check their agreement and enable access.

See the Text and Data Mining on Sage Journals webpage [#sage3]_ for more information on accessing the API and the Sage Journals Text and Data Mining License Agreement [#sage4]_ for more information on API usage.
