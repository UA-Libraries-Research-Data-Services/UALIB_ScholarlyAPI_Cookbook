Brief Overview
****************

PubChem is a database of chemical molecules and their properties. It is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). PubChem is a key chemical information resource for scientists, students, and the general public.
  
The PubChem Periodic Table API provides programmatic access to a machine-readable periodic table. An API key is not required for this API, but a rate limit of 5 requests per second is enforced.

See the PubChem Periodic Table [#ppt1]_ and PubChem APIs documentation [#ppt2]_ for more information on accessing the API. Please check the terms of use [#ppt3]_ for more information on the usage of this API.
