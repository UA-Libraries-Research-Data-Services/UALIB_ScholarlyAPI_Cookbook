Brief Overview
****************

The Bureau of Labor Statistics Public Data API provides access to the data published by the BLS, which primarily concerns prices, employment, compensation, and productivity in the United States. Registration or API keys are not required for the v1.0 API, but registration is required to access the v2.0 API [#us_bls1]_. Additionally, users must follow their rate limits [#us_bls2]_. 

See the BLS terms of service for more information on how the API can be used [#us_bls3]_.
