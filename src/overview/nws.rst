Brief Overview
****************

The National Weather Service (NWS) API provides programmatic access to forecasts and alerts published by the NWS. An API key is not required to access this API, but users are required to include a User Agent with all API requests and adhere to an unpublished rate limit (we recommend sending a maximum of 1 request per second).

See the NWS API documentation [#nws1]_ for more information on accessing the API. Note that the documentation states, "All of the information presented via the API is intended to be open data, free to use for any purpose."
