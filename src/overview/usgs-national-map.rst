The USGS National Map [#usgs2]_ is a collaborative effort among the USGS and other federal, state, and local partners to provide a variety of topographic information. 

You can view or download data from the USGS National Map Viewer [#usgs3]_ and the USGS National Map Downloader [#usgs4]_ respectively.

We will be running their API [#usgs5]_ to observe and download data.
